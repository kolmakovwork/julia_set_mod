# "Julia set" - a set on the complex plane. Generation and visualization of this set and its modifications.

### Project description

Julia set is a set that is located on the complex plane according to a certain formula.

My task is to study the Julia set generation formulas, make a function, select a charmingly beautiful combination, visualize in matplotlib, visualize in good quality in Tableau.

* General information about the Julia set: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set
* Python reference code: https://blbadger.github.io/julia-sets

**My final modified visualizations in Tableau:**
1. Julia set, mod: Chinese dragon https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alexander2244/viz/JuliasetmodChinesedragon/Julia_set_mod
2. Julia set, mod: frost https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alexander2244/viz/Juliasetmodfrost/Julia_set_mod
3. And below in matplotlib, the palette is slightly different

## Research objectives:

1. Study the Julia set generation formulas, create a function;
2. Select a charmingly beautiful combination of parameters and color palette, generate a variety;
3. Visualize the set first in matplotlib;
4. Save this set in fairly good quality, but not slow it down;
5. Visualize this in Tableau as Art.

## General conclusion:
The results were charming pictures âœ¨, I visualized them in advance in matplotlib, saved some of them in good quality, you can see links to visualization in Tableau at the beginning of the project.
